## Introduction

Data on coverage of measles containing vaccines are extracted at
calender dates e.g. monthly or quarterly. Thus being cross sectional
inventories of measles contaning vaccination coverages.

When more cross sectional coverage-data have been collected,
it will be possible to follow coverage over calendar time.

The structural setup is shown in figure 1 and 2, input datasets and
variables in appendix 1 and the combined output R data in appendix 2.

## Input data

Both information on population and vaccinations are needed. Why input
data always have to consist of a set of two data-files.

Valid sets of input data will be one of the following:

-   Indiviudal population file + Individual vaccination file

-   Indiviudal population file + Aggregated vaccination file

-   Aggregated population file + Aggregated vaccination file

while the combination Aggregated population file + Individual
vaccination file will not be a valid set of input data.

Data in a set of input data should be extracted simultanously or as
close in time to one another as possible.\
It is recommend to include date-of-extraction in the naming of the
files.

Note:

-   The input data csv-files must be semicolon-separated csv-files

-   Persons with year of birth \< 2005 should not be included in the
    input data

-   For NUTS, minimum NUTS0 i.e. countrycode (two characters), must be
    included

-   NUTS detailing can maximum be level 3

-   If NUTS-levels more detailed that NUTS0 are used, then all NUTS must
    be at the same level -- in both input files.

## Scripts

**Initially**, create a dedicated directory for this project (wdir), and a
subdirectory in this call data. The later is where input ;-seperated
input files must be located

Example:

* Project directory: S:/Data/MCVCovLoc_wdir_DK

* Subdirectory: S:/Data/MCVCovLoc_wdir_DK/data

### New data

For each inventory/status i.e. dates where a valid set of input data are
available execute InputData.

Example, with an individual population and an individual vaccination file:

```{r eval = FALSE}
MCVCovLoc::InputData(
  wdir = "S:/Data/MCVCovLoc_wdir_DK",
  StatusDate = "2019-10-01",
  IndividuelPopulationFile = "DKIndPop20191001.csv",
  IndividuelMCVFile = "DKIndVac20191001.csv",
  AggregatedPopulationFile = NA,
  AggregatedMCVFile = NA,
  AdministrativeMCVFile = NA
)
```
This will create a subdirectory wdir/Status_20191010 containing
three subdirectories:

* Inputdata -- containing the inputdata used

* Data -- containing the AggPop, AggVac and combined R files

* Output -- containing coverage graphs on NUTS-level 0 for both doses.

### Coverage graphs by Birth cohort

Following the example above, to have a graph of dose 1 coverage by Birth
cohort/year in the NUTS DK01 area:

```{r eval = FALSE}
MCVCovLoc::VacCovBd(
  wdir = "S:/Data/MCVCovLoc_wdir_DK",
  StatusDate = "2019-10-01",
  NUTS = "DK01",
  dose = 1,
  save = TRUE
)
```
which creates this graph in the directory wdir/Status_20191001/Output

Do you only want to see the graph, but not store it on disk, use save = FALSE

### Coverage graphs by age of vaccination

Following the example above, to have a graph of dose 1 coverage by age in
months at vaccination in the NUTS DK01 area:

```{r eval = FALSE}
MCVCovLoc::VacCovAge(
  wdir = "S:/Data/MCVCovLoc_wdir",
  StatusDate = "2019-10-01",
  NUTS = "DK",
  dose = 1,
  save = TRUE
)
```
Which creates this graph in the directory wdir/Status_20191001/Output

Do you only want to see the graph, but not store it on disk, use save = FALSE

![](./media/image2.png){width="6.4in" height="3.6in"}

### Coverage maps

A map of the coverage in a birth-cohort may be drawn on different
NUTS-levels.

Following the example above, for birth-cohort 2005 and dose 2:

```{r eval = FALSE}
MCVCovLoc::MapCov(
  wdir = 'S:/Data/MCVCovLoc_wdir_DK',
  StatusDate = '2019-12-01',
  BirthCohort = 2005,
  NUTS = 'DK01',
  dose = 2,
  save = TRUE
)
```
which creates this map in the directory wdir/Status_20191001/Output

Do you only want to see the map, but not store it on disk, use save = FALSE

![](./media/image3.png){width="6.4in" height="3.6in"}

### Shiny dashboard

To have a dashboard showing all your registered data:

```{r eval = FALSE}
MCVCovLoc::ShowCov(
  wdir = "S:/Data/MCVCovLoc_wdir_DK"
)
```
This will start a Shiny daskboard:

### Inputdata

Minimal means that these variables must be in the files, with the
specified names. There may also be other variables in data e.g. gender,
but these are not included in the coverage calculations and output.
